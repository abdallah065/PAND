# Plant Disease Detection Project

## Introduction
Plant disease detection is an important aspect of agriculture and horticulture. Early detection of plant diseases can prevent the spread of the disease and minimize crop losses. In this project, we aim to develop a system for detecting plant diseases using machine learning algorithms.

## Problem Statement
Plant disease detection is usually a manual process that is time-consuming and requires expertise in plant pathology. The manual process is also prone to errors, which can result in the spread of the disease or misdiagnosis. The need for a reliable and automated system for plant disease detection is clear.

## Solution
The solution we propose is a machine learning-based system that uses image recognition algorithms to detect plant diseases. We have collected a large dataset of plant images, some of which are affected by various diseases. The system uses this data to train a deep learning model that can identify the presence of diseases in new plant images.

## Technical Implementation
The system is built using Python and TensorFlow. The deep learning model is trained using a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. The model is trained on the collected dataset of plant images, and its accuracy is evaluated using a validation set.

## Results
The results of our project show that the system is capable of accurately detecting plant diseases with a high level of accuracy. The model achieved a high accuracy score on the validation set, demonstrating its ability to generalize to new plant images.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, our plant disease detection system provides a reliable and automated solution to the manual process of plant disease detection. The system has the potential to revolutionize the field of agriculture and horticulture by enabling early detection of plant diseases, reducing crop losses, and improving the overall efficiency of the industry.

## Future Work
In the future, we plan to expand the system to cover a wider range of plant diseases and to integrate it with existing agricultural systems. We also plan to improve the system's accuracy and efficiency by exploring new machine learning algorithms and techniques.
